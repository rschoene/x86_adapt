# x86_adapt
A Linux kernel module, that allows changing/toggling system parameters stored in MSR and PCI registers of x86 processors

Its usage was initially presented at Ena-HPC 2013:

Integrating performance analysis and energy efficiency optimizations in a unified environment, R Schöne, D Molka - Computer Science-Research and Development, 2014, [DOI:10.1007/s00450-013-0243-7](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00450-013-0243-7)


## Dependencies
- python
- make
- gcc
- linux kernel > version //TODO: test old debian with 2.6.32
- linux kernel headers

## Install

1. generate the device driver from the template and build the kernel module

```
    $ cd <x86_adapt_folder>
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../
    $ make

```
2. load the kernel module

```
    # This module provides symbols used by the x86_adapt kernel module
    $ insmod kernel_module/definition_driver/x86_adapt_defs.ko
    $ insmod kernel_module/driver/x86_adapt_driver.ko
```
3. (optional) install
```
    $ sudo make install
```
This will install the libraries, binaries and kernel modules to the standard system pathes (e.g. /usr/include and /lib/modules/(kernel version) ).

Remarks:
You can also build a debian package with generate-deb.sh.
This kernel module has to be rebuild with every kernel update.

##  Adding Features/Knobs

To add a new Feature to the driver you have to create new txt file in 
the directory knobs. A knob file uses the following syntax.
Every variable starts with //# and their value is written in the next line.
Strings aren't put into quotes or single quotes and can span multiple
lines. Every variable except restricted_settings is mandatory.

```
//#description
value: String. use this to describe the new feature.
//#device
possible values: MSR, NB_F0, NB_F1, NB_F2, NB_F3, NB_F4, NB_F5, SB_PCU0, SB_PCU1, 
 SB_PCU2, HSW_PCU0, HSW_PCU1, HSW_PCU2. This reflects the PCI Device/Function or MSR.
//#register_index
value: hex number. This defines the MSR/PCI register number.
//#bit_mask
value: bitmask in C syntax. This is used to make only parts of the register available.
//#restricted_settings
value: allowed settings separated by comas, or "readonly"
//#reserved_settings
value: unallowed settings separated by comas
//#processor_groups
value: one or more processor groups delimited by ','
//#CPUID (optional)
operation,check in C sytax : a cpuid check, where you provide an operation (e.g."0a") and a check (e.g, "(eax&0xF) == 2" ). The whole would look like "0a,(eax&0xF) == 2"
//#NDA (optional) defines the knob as NDA
//#name (optional)
override_name: overrides the name defined by the text file. This variable can be used when the same knob has different register locations on different processors.

```


The processor groups are defined as txt files in the directory processors.
They use the same syntax. The following variables are used to describe a
processor.

```
//#vendor
possible values are defined in: arch/x86/include/asm/processor.h, examples: X86_VENDOR_INTEL, X86_VENDOR_AMD
//#families
value: hex number
//#families
value: hex number
//#models
value: one or more hex numbers delimited by ','
```
